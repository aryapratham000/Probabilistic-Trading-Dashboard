# Probabilistic Market Regime & Range Forecasting Dashboard

*A real-time FastAPI + React application for multi-timeframe session classification, conditional probability modeling, and robust regression-based range forecasting.*

## Overview

This project implements a **live trading analytics system** that connects to the **Topstep ProjectX API** to stream ES futures data.  
It processes **1-minute bars**, aggregates them into **1H and 4H structures**, and applies:

- **Markov-based candle classification** for probabilistic regime tracking  
- **Conditional probability filtering** using historical snapshots  
- **Robust regression (Huber) models** to forecast expected ranges  

The results are streamed to a **React-based dashboard** in real time via **FastAPI WebSockets**, providing a probabilistic and statistical perspective on evolving market structure enabling rigorous, data-driven decision-making  

### Conditional Probability Framework
- A core component of the system is the **snapshot-based conditional probability engine**. Each session (1H or 4H) is classified based on its interaction with prior session highs and lows, forming the foundation for regime-aware analysis.  
- Users can apply **customizable filters** through the dashboard—such as prior-day high/low taken, relative range expansions etc. —to narrow probabilities to specific structural contexts.  
- These conditional probabilities are recomputed **live every minute** as new data arrives, ensuring that evolving market structure continuously updates the probability distributions. This provides traders with a dynamic, real-time statistical view of potential outcomes rather than static backtested signals.  

⚠️ For details on how the probability model is constructed, refer to **Session Classification Markov Model** in the repository.

## Features

## Models & Data Dependencies

### Pretrained Models
- `huber_1h_*.pkl` → Robust regression model for **1H range prediction**  
- `huber_4h_*.pkl` → Robust regression model for **4H range prediction**

### Snapshot Data
- `df_1h_snapshots.parquet`  
- `df_4h_snapshots.parquet`  

Used for **conditional probability filtering** & **quantile thresholds**.

⚠️ **Update file paths** in `main.py` and `range_model.py` to point to your local `.pkl` models and snapshot parquet files before running.


## Usage

1. **Set API credentials** in `config.py`.  
2. **Ensure model + snapshot paths** are correct in:  
   - `main.py` → `joblib.load(...)` paths for 1H & 4H models  
   - `markov_model.py` → parquet snapshot paths  
3. **Launch system**:
   ```bash
   python start.py
4. Browser auto-opens the dashboard at:
http://localhost:5173

## Development Pipeline
- Extend coverage to multiple instruments beyond ES (e.g., NQ, CL, FX futures)
- Introduce an ML-based breakout probability model to estimate the likelihood of RTH highs or lows being broken, conditioned on time-since-extreme features, trend structures, and session context
- Add support for **multi-factor features** (macro events, VIX, earnings news) in range forecasting models
- Integrate **alerts & notifications** (email/Slack) for key probability thresholds
- Develop a **Macro & News Intelligence Layer** that summarizes daily news, global events, and earnings reports using LLMs, providing a complementary fundamental perspective alongside the quantitative probability models
